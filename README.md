# Code Refactor Starter Code - by Alan Lee

## Description

The Code Refactor project was inspired by the need to ensure that the Horiseon landing page meets accesibility standards for users of the interface and has a well streamlined and simplfied html markup and css stylesheet. 

This new and updated version of the Horiseon Landing Page features several things.
- 1. Completed and functional links from all the header tabs to the interior body of the webpage. 
- 2. Alternative text on all images for accessbility of the visually impaired or if an image cannot be displayed.
- 3. A new simplified CSS stylesheet with selectors and properties that more riguorsly follow semantic structure.
- 4. A condensed and fully functional HTML markup with more accurate section and divison classes as well as identifiers that simplify the overall code and better match with the CSS stylesheet

With these changes, the Horiseon Landing Page should both be fully functional and accessible to all users as well as easy to adapt and update for future web developers looking into the source code.

Through this process, I have learned the importance of clearly and effectively ordering the elements between both the HTML and the CSS stylesheets. As challenging as semantic structure is, fully embracing it makes reading, repairing, and updating code down the line significantly easier.
